# concordanceofbeowulfandjudith
A concordance of the words in the Anglo-Saxon Poems Beowulf and Judith
This data was compiled to support a conference paper on the Beowulf manuscript by Vince Garin at the University of Denver.
Versions of the data will be marked simply by numbers in 3-digit format, starting with 001. 
Beowulf and Judith data are kept seperate for simplicity's sake. Once other texts are aquired, they will be in their own seperate files as well.
All data is .csv format to make the datasets easy to access and universal. 
Questions and concerns, please contact me at vince.garin@du.edu
